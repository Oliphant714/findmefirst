We are people who care very deeply about our families and want to protect them. Here at Find Me First, we believe that the best way to help our children is through education. In school they learn good things, things that will help them later in life. We, however, want to teach them about situations that could happen to them in their every-day lives.</p>

            <p class="home-text">We teach children what to do when they get lost in public; in the store, at the park, or any other place they might be. We help children learn a variety of skills, including recognizing authoritative figures or employees that they can trust, memory skills to trace their tracks, and appropriate ways to call for help.<br>With interactive games, simple role-play, and basic puzzles, children will develop the knowledge to stay safe, even when they lose track of their parents.</p>
