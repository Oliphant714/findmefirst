      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose is to teach children what to do when they become lost in a public space</p>

<!--Elevator Pitch
Imagine a mother's worst nightmare: she went grocery shopping with her kids but lost her child!  Frantically she begins searching for the kid only to find that her kid found a store associate and is calmly walking toward her.  Can you imagine how relieved and proud she would be, knowing that her child is both okay and knew what to do?  That is what I aim to create; through interactive storytelling and simple games, children will develop the skills and knowledge to handle themselves when they get lost in a public space.-->      

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We are a full-family group; we have trainings for children as well as resources for parents</p>

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Who are we and what do we do?  We are fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  We are people who care very deeply about our families and want to protect them.  Here at Find Me First, we believe that the best way to help our children is through education.  In school they learn good things, things that will help them later in life.  We, however, want to teach them about situations that could happen to them in their every-day lives.  <br>We teach children what to do when they get lost in public; in the store, at the park, or any other place they might be.  We help children learn a variety of skills, including recognizing authoritative figures or employees that they can trust, memory skills to trace their tracks, and appropriate ways to call for help.  <br>With interactive games, simple role-play, and basic puzzles, children will develop the knowledge to stay safe, even when they lose track of their parents.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Do our services cost money? - No.  We are a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children in situations that are often feared but seldom thought about. <br>If you aren't asking for money, why do I need an account? - With an individual or family account, we can deliver more personalized trainings and give your children rewards for meeting milestones.  Without the account, your children will only be able to play some of the games and receive none of the awards. <br>Where are we located? - We are based out of our offices in Rexburg, Idaho.  All of our services are available online and don't require any physical communication. '<br>How to recover an account? - If you are having problems accessing your account, please use the 'Forgot Username/Password' option.  If that is not working for you and you are still having difficulties, please contact our IT department and they will be happy to help you!  <br>How to delete an account? - Once you have logged in to your account, navigate to the Settings menu and scroll down to the bottom.  There should be an option labeled 'Delete My Account'.  Click on that link and follow the instructions.  Please be aware, this is a permanent option and should you want to come back, you will have to restart every course and regain all progress lost. <br>How long will it take for my account to be deleted? - Due to the technical format and secure connections we utilize, you will be unable to access your account immediately after you delete it.  However, it will take us up to a week to completely clear your data out of our system.
